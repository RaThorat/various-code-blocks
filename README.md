# Table reorientation
The code imports the pandas library and creates a dataframe containing information about research grant applications. The data includes the application number, applicant, gender, title of the research, and keywords associated with the research. The data is then grouped by the application number, applicant, gender, and title, and the keywords are aggregated and joined together with commas. The resulting data is stored in a new dataframe called df_pv2. The head of the original dataframe and the new dataframe are displayed.

# Visualisaing and rendering of entity recognizer
This script demonstrates how to use the displacy visualization module from spacy to display named entity recognition (NER) in a web interface. 
## Prerequisites
