#Following code produces a bar chart of combination of disciplines submitted by applicants during a funding round. 
#The interaction is given between technical science and other disciplines from various domain as an example. 
#This graph answers: 
#Are there disciplines that do particularly well in a particular subsidy round?

# Here are a few suggestions to improve your code:

#Use more informative variable names: Instead of using df_305 and chart, consider using more descriptive variable names that explain the data and the chart.

#Use more specific plotting methods: Instead of using the generic catplot method, consider using more specific plotting methods such as barplot or countplot that are better suited for this kind of data.

#Use more efficient data filtering methods: Instead of using the isin method to filter the data, consider using more efficient methods such as query or boolean indexing that can reduce the number of operations required.

#Use more consistent formatting: Instead of using multiple different methods to format the chart, consider using a consistent method such as the pyplot API to format the chart.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.set()
sns.set_context("talk", font_scale=1.6)

# Filter the data to only include technical science disciplines
technical_sciences = df[df["Discipline"] == "Technical science"]

# Create a bar chart of the disciplines and their values
ax = sns.barplot(data=technical_sciences, x="Disciplines", y="Value", hue="Attribute", ci=None)

# Format the chart
ax.set_xticklabels(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45, ha="right")
ax.set(xlabel=None, ylabel=None)
ax.legend(title="Domain")
ax.set_title("Interaction of discipline Technical science with other sciences")
plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.9)
plt.show()

#This updated code uses more specific plotting methods, efficient data filtering methods, and more consistent formatting to produce a clearer and more effective chart.
